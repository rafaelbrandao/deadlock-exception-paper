\chapter{Introduction}


There are two main types of deadlocks: resources deadlocks and communication deadlocks.

Resource deadlocks: a set of threads is holding some resources and is waiting for the resources which have already been held by other threads in the set.
Communication deadlocks: some threads wait for some messages or signals from other threads which are paused and unable to send the required messages/signals or have already sent them before a waiting thread starts to wait for it.

In this work we will focus on resource deadlocks where locks are resources.
