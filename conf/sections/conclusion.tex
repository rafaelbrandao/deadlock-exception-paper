\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we investigated which kind of deadlock is the most popular by looking at actual bug reports
in relevant open source projects and confirmed a previous study claim that TTTL deadlocks
are the most frequent case of deadlock, that is, 92.07\% of all resource deadlocks we identified.
%This claim allowed us to focus on it instead and proposed an algorithm that
%efficiently detects them without any extra lock operations.
We modified Java's \emph{ReentrantLock} and provided a lightweight
version of it that detects TTTL deadlock in runtime.
We measured its performance overhead with a very conservative benchmark
and we estimate our cost to be less than 6\% for worse case on real world applications.
Finally, we did an empirical evaluation to measure its usability and we found that
deadlock exceptions speeds up finding deadlock bugs in code, and we also found some
non-conclusive evidence showing that it may also improve accuracy of deadlock bug reports,
but we leave for future work to verify whether this last observation is actually true.
